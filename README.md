# MSUANet: Multi-Stage Information Sharing Multitask Hyperspectral Classification Network with Unmixing Assistance

This repository contains the official implementation of MSUANet (Multi-Stage Information Sharing Multitask Hyperspectral Classification Network with Unmixing Assistance). MSUANet introduces a multitask learning framework that simultaneously performs hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and spectral unmixing, incorporating a multi-stage cross-task information sharing mechanism. The design enhances discriminative feature learning by leveraging physical interpretability from the unmixing task, ultimately improving classification accuracy.

We will release the complete version of the code as soon as possible. Stay tuned.
