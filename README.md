# MSUANet: Multi-Stage Information Sharing Multitask Hyperspectral Classification Network with Unmixing Assistance

This repository provides the official implementation of **MSUANet**, a novel multitask learning framework designed for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. MSUANet simultaneously performs **HSI classification** and **spectral unmixing**, integrating a multi-stage cross-task information sharing mechanism. By leveraging the physical interpretability from the unmixing task, the model enhances discriminative feature learning, thereby significantly improving classification performance.
