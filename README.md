# MSUANet: Multi-Stage Information Sharing Multitask Hyperspectral Classification Network with Unmixing Assistance
This repository contains the official implementation of MSUANet (Multi-Stage Information Sharing Multitask Hyperspectral Classification Network with Unmixing Assistance). MSUANet introduces a multitask learning framework that simultaneously performs hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and spectral unmixing, incorporating a multi-stage cross-task information sharing mechanism. The design enhances discriminative feature learning by leveraging physical interpretability from the unmixing task, ultimately improving classification accuracy.
